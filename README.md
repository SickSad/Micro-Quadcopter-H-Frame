Introduction
------------
H Frame for the hubsan x4 (or similar) quadcopter. For pictures of (an early version of) the completed frame [see here.](http://imgur.com/a/IOzGq)

The frame is designed to allow transplanting of the full electronics to a new frame without de-soldering anything. It's also approximately 3 grams lighter than the stock hubsan frame (Printing with 10% fill density, 0.15mm layer height, and 1mm shell thickness).


Known Issues
------------

* Positioning of screw holes for mounting flight controller are slightly off. Recommend fitting one screw then drilling out a place for the second.


I Just Want To Print It!
------------------------

For a quadcopter with 7mm motors as used in the Hubsan H107L print the frame_7mm.stl file, for a version of the frame suitable for use with 8.5mm motors as used in Hubsan H107C & H107D print the frame_8mm.stl file. Assembly is fairly straightforward, led's and motors are push fit, you may need to use a scalpel or similar to make the skids fit snuggly. It's recommended to use electrical tape or similar to secure everything in place. Elastic bands work well for holding batteries in.


Enjoy!
