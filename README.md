Introduction
------------
H Frame for the hubsan x4 (or similar) quadcopter. For pictures of the completed frame [see here.](http://imgur.com/a/IOzGq)

The frame is designed to allow transplanting of the full electronics to a new frame without de-soldering anything. It's also approximately 3 grams lighter than the stock hubsan frame (Printing with 10% fill density, 0.15mm layer height, and 1mm shell thickness).


Known Issues
------------

* Positioning of screw holes for mounting flight controller are slightly off. Recommend fitting one screw then drilling out a place for the second.


I Just Want To Print It!
------------------------

Print 1 x frame.stl and 2 x skids.stl. Assembly is fairly straightforward, led's and motors are push fit, you may need to use a scalpel or similar to make the skids fit snuggly. It's recommended to use electrical tape or similar to secure everything in place. Elastic bands work well for holding batteries in.


8.5mm Motor Version
-------------------
Print the frame_8mm.stl file for a version of the frame suitable for using 8.5mm motors (such as those used on the Hubsan 107C & 107D qudacopters).


Enjoy!
